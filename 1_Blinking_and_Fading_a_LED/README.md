# [ENGLISH] Project 1: Blinking and Fading a LED
For you which already are familiar with Arduino ecosystem, no extra effort will be spent in this project, since Arduino/Genuino 101 was developed with Arduino compatibility in mind. That means (most of) what you can run on Arduino/Genuino, will be able to run just fine on Arduino/Genuino 101. If this is your first time coding an Arduino/Genuino board, then it will be fast to learn how to control an I/O pin.
In this project you will need:
* Genuino 101 (1)
* Adapter Shield (1)
* LED Module (1)

Assemble the modules following these steps:
Markup :
1. hello
2. hello          
Plug the Adapter Shield to the top of Genuino 101, then plug the LED Module to 9th header on the Adapter Shield
